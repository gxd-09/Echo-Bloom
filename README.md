Welcome to Echo Bloom - an exciting 2D platformer that takes you on a journey through a magical forest, where you are bound to encounter many different obstacles. With your agility and fast-paced thinking, collect all of the keys in order to unlock the hidden portal and escape! 


The aim of the game is to ultimately get through all of the obstacles, such as: moving platforms, trap plants, poisonous frogs, and more! 


I made this project using the Godot game engine in gdscript, and I've become much more comfortable and familiar with using the software. Initially, a lot of the gameplay mechanics I wanted to implemenent seemed very overwhelming and difficult to achieve, however after breaking down the problem into smaller chunks, I found it overall much more manageable. If there was ever an error I was
struggling to understand, or a bug in the movement or logic of the program, I would get some advice from a friend or do a quick search to remedy the problems. I knew from the get-go that I wanted this game to have an adventurous fantasy vibe, which is why I went with the forest aesthetic and chose some music that was not overly sombre, but still exciting - to elicit a feeling of uncertainty and mystery.


I wanted to make this project as I think 2D platformers are a good way to get into more complex game development, whilst still being a project that is achievable in a short time-frame. That said, I found the process of making it incredibly challenging, and one of the things I struggled most with was figuring out how to make the nodes of my different scenes communicate
in a viable way. Moreover, an important thing I learnt about was global scenes and scripts that can be enabled in autoload, and whose variables you can access from any other scene. This was pivotable as it enabled me not only to do simple things such as implement music and pickup audios throughout the game, but it also aided me in transitioning from level to the next via my "portal", for exmaple.
Debugging the entire thing and making sure I didn't get the dreaded "null instance" error was a huge challenge and rage baited me the entire process. However, the sheer delight from finally making it work was more than enough to make it all worth it.

I hope you enjoy my first 2D platformer :)

Good luck, traveller!
